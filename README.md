# Simulation-of-CPU-scheduling-algorithms
This project is a simulation of the CPU process scheduling algorithm. After the simulation, the system will show the turnaround time and waiting time for each scheduling 
algorithm. This project also contributed by my teammate Tee Wai Bing and Ng Rui Wen

## There CPU process scheduling algorithm will be simulate in this program:

* Preemptive Shorter Job First
* Non Preemptive Shorter Job First
* Non Preemptive Priority
